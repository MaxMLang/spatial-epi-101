## üìñ About the Course

This workbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of spatial epidemiology. Through a series of modules with hands-on exercises and real-world examples, you will learn how to apply spatial statistical methods to:

  * Visualise GIS Data in R üó∫Ô∏è
  * Identify spatial clusters 
  * Explore environmental determinants of health

## üìö Course Structure

The course is divided into the following modules:

  * **Module 1: Mastering R for Spatial Data**

      * Learn to handle, manipulate, and visualize vector and raster data using the `sf`, `terra`, and `tmap` packages.

  * **Module 2: Advanced Spatial Data Handling and Operations**

      * Perform spatial joins, buffering, and extract raster values for defined zones.

  * **Module 3: Remote Sensing Data for Environmental Epidemiology**

      * Process satellite imagery to derive key environmental variables like NDVI and NDWI and apply them to model vector-borne diseases.

  * **Module 4: Validating Remote Sensed Data with Ground-Truth Observations**

      * Validate spatial models and maps against ground-truth data using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other statistical metrics.

  * **Module 5: Analyzing Spatial Clustering**

      * Use spatial statistics like Moran‚Äôs I and Ripley‚Äôs K-function to identify disease clusters and hotspots.

  * **Module 6: Further Reading and Best Practices**

      * Explore a curated list of key textbooks, R packages, and online resources.
      * Learn about the principles of ethical and reproducible research.
